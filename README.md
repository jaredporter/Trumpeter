Trumpeter Tweet Generator
=========================

This is little learning exercise. I wanted to make a LSTM nueral network that could create tweets in the style of Donald Trump as a way to familiarise myself with LSTM NNs. As of now it's a work in progress, but eventually it will hopefully be able to not only tweet on its own, but respond to tweets sent to it. We'll see, but I'll update this as I go...
